# UI Packages docs

This is the documentation website of UI Packages.

To start the docs site in development mode, from the project root, run:

```sh
yarn && yarn docs:dev
```

If you do not have yarn installed, select your OS and follow the instructions on the [Yarn website](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable).

_DO NOT USE NPM, use Yarn to install the dependencies._

## How can I add a new demo to the documentation?

[You can follow this guide](https://github.com/danielmana/ui-packages/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md)
