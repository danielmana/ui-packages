# Color

<p class="description">Convey meaning through color. Out of the box you get access to all colors in the Material Design guidelines.</p>

The Material Design [color system](https://material.io/design/color/) can be used to create a color theme that reflects your brand or style.

## Playground

To test a color scheme with the UI Packages documentation, simply select colors using the palette and sliders below.
Alternatively, you can enter hex values in the Primary and Secondary text fields.
