# UI Core - Overview

<p class="description">UI Core is a library of ready-to-use core components.</p>

## Introduction

UI Core is a React component library that implements Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/).

It includes a comprehensive collection of prebuilt components that are ready for use in production right out of the box.

:::info
UI Core is build in the top of Material UI v5, which supports Material Design v2.
Adoption of v3 is tentatively planned for Material UI v6—see [the release schedule](https://mui.com/versions/#release-schedule).
You can follow [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/29345) for future updates.

## Advantages of UI Core

- **Ship faster:** UI Core gives you pre-built components with a sleek and carefully designed look and feel, so you don't need design skills to ship beautiful UIs rapidly. Over 2,500 open-source [contributors](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/graphs/contributors) have poured countless hours into the foundation for these components.
  Focus on your core business logic instead of reinventing the wheel—we've got your UI covered.
- **Beautiful by default:** we're meticulous about our implementation ensuring that every component meets the highest standards of form and function, but diverge from the official spec where necessary to provide multiple great options.
- **Customizability:** the library includes an extensive set of intuitive customizability features.
- **Cross-team collaboration:** UI Core's intuitive developer experience reduces the barrier to entry for back-end developers and less technical designers, empowering teams to collaborate more effectively.
  The [design kits](https://mui.com/design-kits/) streamline your workflow and boost consistency between designers and developers.
- **Trusted by thousands of organizations:** UI Core is based on [Material UI](https://github.com/mui/material-ui), which has the largest UI community in the React ecosystem.
  It's almost as old as React itself—its history stretches back to 2014.
  We can count on community's support for years to come (e.g. [Stack Overflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=material-ui)).

## UI Core vs. Material UI

UI Core is intended to serve as an alternative to Material UI with extended capabilities.

These two libraries feature many of the same components, and similarly designed component APIs, so you can quickly start building with one if you've used the other before.

By wrapping Material UI components we are able to isolate the dependencies and integrate different frameworks, giving us the freedom to change the dependencies with no harm for parent projects.

## Principles

### Include only what's essential

UI Core should work with the least amount of effort possible.

Components should have only what they need to do the job.
What is considered essential is drawn from MUI's experience over the years developing component libraries, as well as from benchmarks of modern API and design guidelines—especially when it comes to developing web apps.

### Make it beautiful out of the box

UI Core needs to be simple yet characteristic.
Visual attributes such as scale, size, and density should be consistent across all of the components so they live together nicely.

We aim to spark delight with simplicity and attention to detail.
You should feel like your UI looks great from the start.

### Encourage creativity

Working with UI Core shouldn't feel stiff or rigid—you should feel inspired and empowered to change, extend, and revamp UI Core's appearance and behavior with ease.
We want it to become your go-to starting point for building UIs.

### Prioritize developer experience

A great developer experience is not only about the quality of the code we ship, but also about how clear the documentation is, and what learning resources are available for developers.
