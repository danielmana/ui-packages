# UI Core - Overview

<p class="description">UI Core is a library of ready-to-use core components.</p>

## Introduction

UI Core is a React component library that implements Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/).

It includes a comprehensive collection of prebuilt components that are ready for use in production right out of the box.

:::info
UI Core is build in the top of Material UI v5, which supports Material Design v2.
Adoption of v3 is tentatively planned for Material UI v6—see [the release schedule](https://mui.com/versions/#release-schedule).
You can follow [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/29345) for future updates.

## Advantages of Material UI

- **Ship faster:** Over 2,500 open-source [contributors](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/graphs/contributors) have poured countless hours into these components.
  Focus on your core business logic instead of reinventing the wheel—we've got your UI covered.
- **Beautiful by default:** we're meticulous about our implementation of [Material Design](https://material.io/), ensuring that every Material UI component meets the highest standards of form and function,
  but diverge from the official spec where necessary to provide multiple great options.
- **Customizability:** the library includes an extensive set of intuitive customizability features. [The templates](https://mui.com/store/) in our store demonstrate how far you can go with customization.
- **Cross-team collaboration:** Material UI's intuitive developer experience reduces the barrier to entry for back-end developers and less technical designers, empowering teams to collaborate more effectively.
  The [design kits](https://mui.com/design-kits/) streamline your workflow and boost consistency between designers and developers.
- **Trusted by thousands of organizations:** Material UI has the largest UI community in the React ecosystem.
  It's almost as old as React itself—its history stretches back to 2014—and we're in this for the long haul.
  You can count on community's support for years to come (e.g. [Stack Overflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=material-ui)).

## UI Core vs. Material UI

UI Core and [Material UI](https://mui.com/) feature many of the same UI components, but UI Core comes with extended capabilities and additional components outside the scope of Material UI.

By wrapping Material UI components we are able to isolate the dependencies and integrate different frameworks, giving us the freedom to change the dependencies with no harm for parent projects.
